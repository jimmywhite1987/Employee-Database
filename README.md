# `Employee Database`

## Project Description

-  The goal of this project is to take the dataset, an employee database, to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files (located in the data folder).
- Then, importing each CSV file into a corresponding table, an analysis will be performed on the dataset.
- The analysis will include taking the information given and making a more comprehensive database by linking the "incomplete" data files and joining them together using SQL in a fashion that makes it easy to use and much more detailed and comprehensive.
- The final result will be a database that's much easier to use and understand.
